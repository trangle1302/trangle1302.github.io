I am currently a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. Emma Lundberg](https://se.linkedin.com/in/emma-lundberg-70a87b25) in the [Cell Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/cell) of the [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/) at Science for Life Laboratory and KTH Royal Insitute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. I finished my master thesis in the [Cell Profiling group](https://cellprofiling.org/) in Spring 2018, and came back since August 2019 for PhD study. My PhD mainly  focuses on modelling and analyzing spatial patterns of proteins in fluorescent images from a single cell perspective. Furthermore, I build web-based tools for annotation and interactive model training on biomedical images.
