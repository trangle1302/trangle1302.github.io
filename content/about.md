👋 Hi, I’m Trang!
I earned my Ph.D. in Bioengineering from Stanford University, where I was fortunate to work with [Emma Lundberg](https://lundberglab.stanford.edu/), and my thesis committee members [Russ Altman](https://profiles.stanford.edu/russ-altman), [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/), and [Barbara Engelhardt](https://profiles.stanford.edu/barbara-engelhardt).

My dissertation — “Towards a Systematic Understanding of Human Cells through Data-Driven Models of Spatial Proteomics” — explored a spatial proteomic - centric, data-driven approach for virtual cell modeling, or at least a foundation for it.
