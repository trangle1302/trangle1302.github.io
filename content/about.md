I am currently a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. Emma Lundberg](https://se.linkedin.com/in/emma-lundberg-70a87b25) in the [Cell Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/cell) of the [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/) at Science for Life Laboratory and KTH Royal Insitute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. I have moved to [Stanford BioE](https://bioengineering.stanford.edu/people/trang-le) to continue my PhD with the same topic(s). I finished my master thesis in the [Cell Profiling group](https://cellprofiling.org/) in Spring 2018, and, after a year in Francis Crick Institute (London) investing cancer gene heterogeneity, came back since Fall 2019 for PhD study. My PhD mainly focuses on modelling and analyzing spatial patterns of proteins in fluorescent images from a single cell perspective. Furthermore, I build web-based tools for annotation and interactive model training on biomedical images.
